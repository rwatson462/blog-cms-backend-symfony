### Boilerplate code

> If anyone wants to see the code _I_ have written, please ignore these files

Symfony includes a lot of boilerplate code that I haven't touched, this list of files should be
exhaustive:


* .gitignore
* composer.json
* composer.lock
* symfont.lock
* bin/console
* config/*
* public/index.php
* src/Kernel.php
